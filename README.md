# electric-boray

This repository is part of the Joyent Manta project.  For contribution
guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta) project page.

# Building and running

To run your own electric-boray from a copy of this repository, you'll want:

* a Manta deployment, which includes at least one metadata shard of Boray and
  Manatee,
* an electric-boray configuration file, and
* an electric-boray consistent hash ring configuration.

Once you've got these pieces in place, install the dependencies:

    $ make

update your path:

    $ source env.sh

and run electric-boray with something like this:

    $ node ./main.js -f /path/to/config.json -r /path/to/hash/ring -p 2020 \
        2>&1 | bunyan

For example, if the configuration file and hash ring were copied to your
electric-boray workspace, you'd use:

    $ node ./main.js -f ./config.json -r ./leveldb-2021 -p 2020 2>&1 | bunyan


# Testing

First, make sure you're running a local copy of electric-boray as described
above.  Then, run the test suite:

    $ make test

This assumes that an electric-boray server is running on localhost port 2020.
